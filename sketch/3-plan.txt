- Generate solutions to the n-rooks problem, one row at a time
- For each new row:
    - Check each column that isn't occupied yet
        - Calculate the diagonal ids
        - Make sure neither diagonal is occupied. Break otherwise
        - Make a copy of the sets of remaining columns and diagonals
        - Remove the column and diagonal ids we just used
